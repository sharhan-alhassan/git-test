### git status
- this command tells us gives us the status of the project like where we are in (main or branch)
- origin/main: actually *origin* is a new concept known as *remote*, which is the 'remote source' (github or bitbucket) different from what is on your local machine
- github is our origin

### git remote -v (-v for vebose)
This command lists all of our remotes. The remote is named 'origin'. this remote was automatically setup for us when we first run 'git clone'

### git add
This command tells git to track files by adding them.

### git commit
This command is used in saving a unit chunk of work all at once. It's best best practice to add a message to show what kind of commits/save you're making.

### git commint -m
This adds the 'message' flag to show why or what's the commit about

### git log
Gives detail of each commit made with the date, commit message, and commit SHA -- a unique ID generated by a hashing algorithm for this commit. 
- Other information close to the commit SHA are;
    1. (HEAD -> main) -- this info is next to the latest commit
    2. (origin/main, origin/HEAD) -- this info is next to the commit before the latest commit

### git push
- This command is used to update the 'source of truth' - the origin remote -aka Github
- The command is used and we specify "where we want to push and what branch we want to push to".
- git push origin main
    clarification
    - git push origin(to remote Github) main(to the main branch)
    the output of the push gives:
    - `2566....aete(SHA) main - >main`
    - meaning, we have pushed our main branch to Github's main branch
